# Hi there,

I am currently a PhD candidate in statistics at the [University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/). I am interested in the development and application of efficient uncertainty quantification techniques for large--scale inverse problems governed by partial differential equations.

I have a master's degree in engineering science from the [University of Auckland](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/). My thesis investigated the application of ensemble Kalman methods to inverse problems and optimal experimental design problems arising in geothermal reservoir engineering. Prior to this, I received a bachelor's degree (also in engineering science) with a focus on statistical learning and optimisation techniques.
